## ⚙️ How to run the application locally

1. **Clone the repository**

npm install

2.**Technical Choices**
```
Vite + React: For fast bundling and smooth development experience.
React functional components & hooks: Simple, modern React architecture.
Bootstrap & react-bootstrap: To quickly create a clean, responsive UI without writing custom CSS from scratch.
Manual state management: Since the application is simple, I used local state in components instead of Context API or Redux.
JSON as mock data: Simulates an API call without needing a real backend.
